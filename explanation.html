The most widespread one is <a href="#humanism">humanism</a>.</p>
									<p id="humanism"><b>Humanism:</b> A belief in human value. Is a method of distinguishing <a href="#good-vs-bad">good versus bad</a>. Widespread belief. Accomplished in varieties of different ways. A common method is increasing human <a href="#happiness" class="tooltip">happiness<span class="tooltiptext">A measure of wellbeing</span></a>. Most moral goods are in the form of humanism, some are in the form of <a href="#sentientism">sentientism</a>.</p>
									<p id="happiness"><b>Happiness:</b> A measure of wellbeing. Commonly pursued goal. Commonly quantified as lasting <a href="#pleasure" class="tooltip">pleasure <span class="tooltiptext">Desirable sensations</span></a> or the absence of <a class="tooltip">suffering <span class="tooltiptext">Undesirable sensations</span></a>. <a href="#reality-changing" class="tooltip">Reality-changing <span class="tooltiptext">Changing the objective reality (moving an object)</span></a> and <a href="#belief-changing" class="tooltip">belief-changing <span class="tooltiptext">Changing one's subjective (perception of) reality</span></a> are methods of happiness-pursuit.

Commonly pursued by <a href="#humanism">humanists</a>. Solving <a href="#problems">the problems</a> is important when doing happiness-pursuit due to possibility of reduced consciousness through death, and reduced happiness through common suffering-inducing environments.</p>
									<p id="reality-changing"><b>Reality-changing:</b> Changing the <a href="#universe" class="tooltip">objective reality <span class="tooltiptext">Status of any point/situation in the universe</span></a>. Usually to achieve a goal. Reality-changing is usually pursued by humans when feeling <a href="#dissatisfaction">dissatisfaction</a>. The extent of reality-changing is reflected by the <a class="tablinks" onclick="openCity(event, 'interest')" href="#interest" class="tooltip">interests<span class="tooltiptext">Opinions, goals, values</span></a> of those pursuing it.</p>
									<p id="belief-changing"><b>Belief-changing:</b> Changing one's <a href="#consciousness" class="tooltip">subjective reality <span class="tooltiptext">Reality as experienced<span></a></span>. Usually to achieve a goal.</p>
									<p id="survival"><b>Survival:</b> Act of staying alive. Used to be dependent on good adaption. Is today dependent on ensuring needs-distributions. <a href="#infant-emotionalism">Semi-naturally pursued due to genetic coding</a>. Commonly pursued by <a href="#humanism">humanists</a>. Important to many happiness-pursuers due to consciousness being valued.</p>
									<p id="needs"><b>Needs:</b> Human requirements for survival. Food, water, shelter, air, sleep.</p>
									<p id="needs-distribution"><b>Needs-distribution:</b> A system where survival is ensured. The currently most widespread needs-distribution system is <a class="tooltip">capitalistic<span class="tooltiptext">Relies on the interest of the resource-holders</span></a>, and is likely to stop distribution once the resource-holders no longer have interest in general human survival, which is a part of <a href="#problems">the problems</a>.</p>

										<!--THE REASON FOR CHANGE-->
									<p id="problems"><b>The problems:</b> Greatest threats to general human survival and happiness. Solving these are the main focus of this website. Extreme danger: <a href="#human-obsoleteness">Human obsoleteness</a>. Major danger: <a href="#rise-of-centralization">Rise of centralization</a>. Major danger: <a href="#return-of-conflict">Return of conflict</a>. Major danger: <a href="#ecological-crisis">Ecological crisis</a>. Major danger: <a href="#accidents">Technological accidents</a>. Minor danger: <a href="#natural-threats">Natural threats</a>. Minor danger: <a href="#anatomical-superiority">Anatomical superiority</a>.</p>
									<p id="human-obsoleteness"><b>Human obsoleteness:</b> Humans no longer being relevant in <a class="tooltip">general societal process<span class="tooltiptext">Not useful for achieving common societal goals</span></a>. <a href="#workplace">Workplace</a> and <a href="#decision-making">Decision-making</a> obsoleteness will cause most possible harm.</p>
									<p id="rise-of-centralization"><b>Rise of centralization:</b> <a class="tooltip">Centralized dataflow<span class="tooltiptext">Concentration of information (and processing power)</span></a> and centralized power becoming more effective than decentralized ones. Centralized dataflow becoming more effective is due to the rise of information-technology, allowing many previous flaws of centralization to be solved. Includes: limited processing power in humans, lack of information-communication, corruptability of centralized systems. Advantages of dataflow make centralized better at goal-achieving than decentralized. Power-centralization is more effective due to <a href="#human-obsoleteness">human obsoleteness</a>, which makes human power-holding ineffective compared to computing machines. Decentralized will be obsolete, contributing to <a href="#fall-of-liberalism">fall of liberalism</a>. Centralization is commonly found in authoritarian societies, which is commonly unwanted.</p>
									<p id="return-of-conflict"><b>Return of conflict:</b> Conflict, especially war becoming viable again. Innovation of <a href="#neo-arsenal" class="tooltip">counter-weapons<span class="tooltiptext">Reducing effectiveness of massdestruction weaposn</span></a>, new <a href="#neo-arsenal" class="tooltip">massdestruction-weapons<span class="tooltiptext">For example nuclear weapons<span></a>, and <a href="#dataism">dataism</a> cause this. Counter-weapons make previously <a class="tooltip">assured mutually-destructive scenarios<span class="tooltiptext">Scenarios where both parties are extremely likely to be at a loss</span></a> less assured. New massdestruction-weapons create new methods of extinction and war. An arms-race is encouraged by possibility of meaningful destruction. Arms-race commonly causes tension. Dataism is likely to cause a collapse of cooperation due to fear of <a href="#human-hacking">human hacking</a>. This results in <a href="#world-of-conflict">a dangerous isolationist, brinkman-like, and survivalist scenario</a>.</p>
									<p id="ecological-crisis"><b>Ecological crisis:</b> Human neglect of ecological collapse. <a href="#ecological-collapse">Global environment is becoming more unsuited for human inhabitance</a>. <a href="#ecological-neglect">This is due to a prioritization of non-environmental interests</a>.</p>
									<p id="accidents"><b>Technological accidents:</b> Improper handling of dangerous technologies. Most concerning possibilities are: <a href="#ai">Hostile AI superintelligence</a>, <a href="#neo-arsenal" class="tooltip">Hostile nanites<span class="tooltiptext">"Nanites" is short for nano-entities</span></a>, for example organisms and robots</span>, and <a href="#nuclear-apocalypse">Nuclear accidents</a>. Preventable with thorough examination. Thorough examinations are difficult in realities with pressure; notably <a href="#competitive-society">competitive society</a> and <a href="#world-of-conflict"class="tooltip">world of conflict<span class="tooltiptext">Many 'real-power'-holding entities becoming isolationist, brinkman-like and survialist</span></a>. Difficulty to solve while <a href="#competitiveness">competitiveness</a> is rampant.</p>
									<p id="workplace"><b>Workplace obsoleteness:</b> The process of human obsoleteness in the workplace. Is happening due to <a class="tooltip">humanity<span class="tooltiptext">Act of being human-like. Includes having arms, brain, heart</span></a> not being <a class="tooltip">employable<span class="tooltiptext">Useful to resource-holders in capitalist qualifying</span></a>, and <a href="#distance-of-the-future">development of correct technologies</a>. Increases the <a href="#growing-inequality">growing inequality</a> and allows for a <a href="#plutocratic-coalition">plutocratic coalition</a>. Obsolete individuals must rely on <a href="humanism">humanistic</a> <a href="#needs-distribution">needs-distribution</a>, due to the lack of <a class="tooltip">unprotected resources<span class="tooltiptext">Resources not claimed by a real-powerful entity</span></a>.</p>
									<p id="decision-making"><b>Decision-making obsoleteness:</b> The process of human obsoleteness with their decision-making. Is happening due to <a class="tooltip">info-technology<span class="tooltiptext">Computers, processors, software. They have the potential to exceed natural human dataflow abilities, and to understand individuals better than themselves through pattern-finding</span>, and <a class="tooltip">availability of info-technology<span class="tooltiptext">Info-technology increasingly commonly being used for understanding humans</span></a>. <a href="human-hacking">Human hacking</a> may be applied.</p>
									<p id="dataism"><b>Dataism:</b> A valuing of information and processing power, dataflow. Is practiced through <a class="tooltip">information-gathering<span class="tooltiptext">Surveillance, touching, seeing, feeling</span></a>, and <a class="tooltip">information-processing<span class="tooltiptext">Comparing, experimenting</span></a> to increase dataflow. Commonly adopted due to assistance in goal-achieving. Dataism as a higher priority than trust (especially prone to happen with nationalism) can contribute to <a href="#return-of-conflict">return of conflict</a>.</p>
									<p id="human-hacking"><b>Hacking of humans:</b> Act of using information of an individual to control them. Can happen due to synthetic dataistic supremacy over natural human dataflow ability, and human decision-making being based on <a href="#material-process"class="tooltip">an understandable and interferable system<span class="tooltiptext">Decision-making is based on emotions, which is predictable and easily manipulateable</span></a>. Allows data-warfare: dataism regarding individuals to control them. Contributes to <a href="#return-of-conflict">return of conflict</a>.</p>
									<p id="fall-of-liberalism"><b>Fall of liberalism:</b> The process of liberalism's collapse and its replacement. Core ideas of liberalism no longer are viable: <a href="#liberalism">Liberal reliance on human <a href="#politics">political</a> and <a href="#economics">economical</a> value</a> makes the system ineffective when compared to some alternatives, most notably <a href="#techno-totalitarianism">technological dictatorships</a>, greatly contributing to the dissatisfaction with liberalism. Capitalism cannot benefit humans when humans cannot benefit capitalism, which can result in a <a href="#plutocratic-coaltition">plutocratic coalition</a>, is solvable due to capitalism mostly influencing values being used in the system. Human hacking can discredit democratic societies, potentially causing disuse of the technology, creating a disadvantage. Liberal collapse: Not abandoning liberalism leads to <a class="tablinks" onclick="openCity(event, 'hostility')"href="#hostility"class="tooltip">outcompetition<span class="tooltiptext">Being outcompeted due to being disadvantaged</span></a>. People with emphasis for <a href="#survival">survival</a> and <a href="#happiness">happiness</a> over <a href="#inflexibility"class="tooltip">liberal loyalty (inflexibility)<span class="tooltiptext">Heeding to unbreakable fictional rules</span></a> will abandon liberalism.</p>
									<p id="growing-inequality"><b>Growing inequality:</b> Distribution of <a href="#reality-changing">reality-changing</a> abilities and <a class="tooltip">luxuries<span class="tooltiptext">Things believed to increase happiness</span></a> becoming more concentrated. Is expected to increase due to reality-changing centralization becoming more effective and <a href="#workplace">workplace obsoleteness</a> resulting in median lowered resource-having. <a href="#anatomical-superiority">Anatomical superiority</a> can further increase inequality, due to being regarded as a luxury and capable of increasing <a href="#services">manual economic worth</a>.</p>
									<p id="plutocratic-coalition"><b>Plutocratic coalition:</b> Resource-holders seeking to create an exclusive global government. Distinct from resource-holders seeking to create an inclusive global government. <a class="tooltip">Capitalist resource-holders<span class="tooltiptext">Rich people</span></a> are commonly observed as <a href="#evil-capitalists">ruthless, selfish, risk-takers, flexible, and efficient</a>. There is no reason for this to change. Continuation of past behavior can be a neglect or removal of useless entities like humans or unaligned entites like governments. Accomplished through fast creation of <a href="#neo-arsenal">new-age arsenal</a>, giving a technological advantage. This can cause extreme reduction in human population and higher <a href="#growing-inequality">inequality</a> before the reduction. Motivated by a <a href="#technological-paradise">promise of paradise</a> and <a href="#problems">the problems</a> being a threat while government are not working to solve them. Escaping to Mars would not be optimal, since the problems would still have to be solved. Potential members of a plutocratic coalition could be stopped and absorbed if given a <a class="tooltip">legitimate<span class="tooltiptext">Convincing</span></a> promise of the same.</p>
									<p id="statist-attempt"><b>Statist attempt:</b> A state attempting to create an exclusive global government. Unlikely to be done before <a href="#return-of-conflcit">return of conflict</a>, due to states not being known for technological pursuit. Exception is <a class="tooltip">China<span class="tooltiptext">Powerful entity</span>, which has an interest in <a class="tablinks" onclick="openCity(event, 'dataism')"href="#dataism">dataism</a>. A statist attempt will likely keep more humans than a <a href="#plutocratic-coalition">plutocratic coalition</a>, due to <a href="#vigilance">vigilants</a> having a higher chance to be part of a state.</p>
									<p id="disunity"><b>Disunity:</b> Global cooperation being needed to solve <a href="#problems">the problems</a> while there is not enough and general expectations for decline. The <a href="#rise-of-nationalism">rise of nationalism</a> has been contributing to disunity. <a href="#return-of-conflict">Return of conflict</a> is expected to reduce unity.</p>
									<p id="world-of-conflict"><b>World of conflict:</b> Many real-powerful entities becoming isolationist and survialist. All powerful entities are possible contenders. Is caused by <a href="#return-of-conflict">return of conflict</a>. Evolves exponentially with time passing. Isolationism is due to breakdown of cooperation due to fear of <a href="#human-hacking">human hacking</a>. Higher production results in more dataflow potential and superior weapon-creation of <a href="#neo-arsenal">usable weapons</a>. Entities with low production must use <a class="tooltip">extreme strategies<span class="tooltiptext">Preemptive strikes, reckless technological development</span></a> to <a href="#survival">survive</a>. Mutual destruction might be prefered over loss. Loss and surrender is also a subverting of will, due to human hacking. This scenario can only end when only one agenda is remaining, or a purge of technology is agreed upon.</p>

Logic and rationality as a moral value/interest is always secondary to <a href="#emotionalism">emotionalism</a> and sometimes <a class="tooltip">ultimate goals<span class="tooltiptext">A pursuit of highest interest</span></a>. Logic and rationality is attained when reality is discussed with only its contents (no good and bad).</p>
									<p id="estimating"><b>Estimating:</b> Act of reality-finding with patterns.</p>
									<p id="bio-vs-syn"><b>Biological-synthetic indifference:</b> Biological and synthetic processes being able to accomplish the same. Carbon-based processes versus silicon-based ones are the same <a class="tooltip">protons and electrons<span class="tooltiptext">Very small things material objects consist of</span></a>, but arranged in a different manner.</p>
									<p id="unobservable-universe"><b>The unobservable universe:</b> A possible reality outside of the observable universe. Could have other observable universes (many world theory). Could be inside another universe (simulation theory). Could not exist. No direct information exists regarding it.</p>
									<p id="space-time"><b>Space-time:</b> Our plane of existence. Being at a certain time is called being in a time or period. Being at a certain space is called being in a location. Being in both time and location is being in a situation or point.</p>
									<p id="good-vs-bad"><b>Good versus bad:</b> "Good" describes helpfulness for achieving a goal. "Bad" describes unhelpfulness for achieving a goal. A word describing something with either goodness, badness, or both, is "loaded".</p>
									<p id="bad-truth"><b>Bad truth:</b> If a fact is believed to be bad, it is a bad truth. Sometimes ignored with belief-changing if not solvable with reality-changing.</p>
									<p id="loaded-words"><b>Loaded words:</b> People imagining words have the tendency to assign words properties of good and bad. When words with the properties of imagined good and bad are interpreted, interpretations may be influenced.</p>
									<p id="patterns"><b>Patterns:</b> Aspects in reality which repeat. Likeliness is the estimated chance for a repetition. Strength of pattern is measured by instances and relation with other patterns and observations.</p>
									<p id="exponentiality"><b>Exponential patterns:</b> A function which doubles with every change.</p>
									<p id="fictions"><b>Fictions:</b> Imagined <a href="#things">things</a>. Anything not real. A prominent fiction is <a href="#humans">humans</a>.</p>
									<p id="value"><b>Value:</b> Something with <a href="#fictions">fictional</a> worth, or being good or bad in situations. This is due to the universe having no sense of <a href="#good-vs-bad">good and bad</a>. Another word for <a href="#interest">interest</a>.</p>
									<p id="naturalness"><b>Naturalness:</b> If it is within the laws of the universe, it is natural. Creation of humans and animals was a coincidence. Creation of norms and traditions is culture.</p>
									<p id="thing"><b>Thing:</b> Something which does not necessarily: exist, have comprihensability, and follow the laws of the universe. Used to describe fictions, non-fictions, and <a class="tooltip">non-existence<span class="tooltiptext">Something not in our universe</span></a>. Describing what existence is to someone who does not experience it, is like describing color to a blind person, hence the odd explanation.</p>

										<!--TECHNOLOGY-->
									<p id="nuclear-apocalypse"><b>Nuclear apocalypse:</b> Scenario of high human death and suffering involving nuclear weapons. Possible due to high destruction ability of nuclear weapons including: Invisible submarine attack, dangerous dust (fallout), massive explosions, large oceans usable as flooding devices.</p>
									<p id="implications-of-dataflow"><b>Implications of dataflow:</b> Discussion regarding the effects of dataflow. Dataflow results in: Reality simulation: The infomation collected can be used to simulate reality and find inconsistencies like faked or missing information. No corruption or other crime can happen. Perfect intelligent qualifying due to perfect knowledge regarding reality (near perfect). Easily becomes a <a href="#techno-totalitarianism">technological dictatorship</a>, due to that being best for dataflow. Culture-change: Cultural discrimination like place of birth and mental conditions could be more severe due to the access of information. Using the dataflow to determine a solution is easily done. Cultural adaption will also happen, leading to more tolerance, much including the general equal exposure of everyone. Anti-copyright: No copyright reduces restrictions for usage. Makes more information available. No ownership reduces capitalist interest. Dataflow can hack people into working regardless of interest.</p>
									<p id="gene-technology"><b>Genetic engineering:</b> Act of changing the genome. 10 000 old practice through domestication. Modern methods involve adding new lines of code to embryos directly instead of culling the weak.</p>
									<p id="nanites"><b>Nanites:</b> Nanoscopic entities. Can be used for disease-fighting in almost endless different variations, unlike anti-microbial substances.</p>
									<p id="techno-totalitarian-inevitability"><b>Techno-totalitarian inevitability:</b> Possibility of techno-totalitarian regimes being the ultimate result of human evolution. Techno-totalitarianism allows for <a href="#techno-utopianism">techno-utopianism</a>, which is the highest amount of <a class="tooltip">emotional pleasing<span class="tooltiptext">Distinct from pleasure</span></a> possible. Humans are <a href="#emotionalist">emotionalist</a>, seeking emotional pleasing. Techno-totalitarian dataflow also allows winning all competitions.</p>
