									<p id="ecological-collapse"><b>Ecological collapse:</b> A number of semi-related events estimated to eventually collapse the earth's ecosystem. The human <a class="tooltip">habitat<span class="tooltiptext">Conditions creating a suitable location for survival and happiness</span></a> will not survive the collapse, due to the slim <a href="#space-time">situation</a> in space-time it is base on. Ecosystems are easily disturbed and cause further changes in the environment when disrupted. Ecological disruptions are: <a href="#dangerous-waste">Dangerous waste</a>, <a href="#natural-selection-enouragement">Natural selection encouragement</a>.</p>
									<p id="ecological-neglect"><b>Ecological neglect:</b> Neglect of the ecological collapse. Is justified by climate-denialism, "Will die before it kills me", other pursuits being more important.</p>
									<p id="dangerous-waste"><b>Dangerous waste:</b> Unwanted products capable of harming the global ecosystem. Includes: <a href="#space-junk">Space-junk</a>, <a href="#acidic-materialis">Acidic materials</a>, <a href="#plastics">Plastics</a>, <a href="#organic-materials">Organic materials</a>, <a href="general-waste">Other junk</a>, <a href="#gases">Gases</a>.</p>

									<p id="plastics"><b>Plastics:</b> Material notable for its resilient nature. Its resilience is based on it <a class="tooltip">not being part of the global ecosystem<span class="tooltiptext">Meaning nature has not developed methods for breaking it</span></a>, while also being resistant to <a class="tooltip">conventional methods of destruction<span class="tooltiptext">For example bacteria or insects</span></a>. Harm is usually done to ecosystems when introduced in large quantities. Lower quantities called micro-plastics have been theorized to also have adverse effects. Much plastics are in harmful locations for the ecosystem. Plastics are commonly produced and disposed off by humans. For scale and severity, consult other sources.</p>
									<p id="acidic-materials"><b>Acidic materials:</b> Acidic waste is known to have many adverse effects on the ecosystem. Acid in water can become acidic rain and water-bodies, becoming harmful for life, killing both plants and animals at large doses. Consult other sources for severity.</p>
									<p id="space-junk"><b>Space-junk:</b> Bad objects left by humans stuck in the atmosphere. Usually in the form of metals degraded into smaller objects. Objects orbit the earth at rapid enough pace to destroy other objects like satellites. Destruction of objects creates more space-junk. Space-junk eventually falls down from orbit. Has the potential to cause Kessler syndrome, the inability leave or enter the earth. Is removable due to being a <a href="#material-process">material-process</a>. Consult other sources for information regarding severity and solutions.</p>
									<p id="organic-materials"><b>Organic materials:</b> Edibles left by humans. Eaten usually by rats and bugs. Has created animals specialized for living in human environments. Helps spread of disease, like in the black death. Not very problematic, due to modern technology.</p>

									<p id="gases"><b>Gases:</b> Gases being improperly disposed off, usually into the atmosphere. Lingers in the atmosphere due to the earth's gravitational pull. Consists of materials similar to smoke, causing damage to airways, and thereby general function through extended interaction. Blamed for changes in general temprature on the earth, due to ability to reflect heat, preventing escape from the earth (is like thick clothing). Estimations vary on how much gas is being dumped into the atmosphere by humans versus nature, and how much is needed for warming. Common consensus among <a href="#qualifications">qualified</a> scientists is of humans upsetting a natural balance, causing rapid warming.</p>
									<p id="pesticides"><b>Pesiticides:</b> Poisons used to kill annoying species. Evidence exists to link this to <a href="#death-of-bees">death of bees</a>.</p>
									<p id="animal-killing"><b>Animal-killing:</b></p>
									<p id="medicine"><b>Medicine:</b> The use of medicine to fight germs has culled the weak and left the resistant. Applies most notably to bacteria, due to ability to transfer immunity and reliance on medicine to fight them. The use of anti-bacterial medicine has created bacteria with immunity to multiple medicines, known as superbugs. Resistance to medicine will be a non-problem with <a href="#nanites">disease-hunting nanites</a>. Consult other sources for the extent of superbugs today and estimates for superbugs tomorrow.</p>
									<p id="death-of-bees"><b>Death of bees:</b> Bees dying more than usual, on the path to extinction. Many plants require bee-pollination to survive. Some estimations say 70% of food will be lost from death of bees. Can be stopped by <a href="#engineering">engineering</a> better bees, stopping the reasons for death, and engineering better plants. Will be expensive. Consult other sources for severity.</p>

									<p id="notice"><b>Notice:</b> Words used on this website are not always common definitions. This is due to the lack of words for description in the English language, along with some definitions seeming more suitable for words. Extreme deviations from the norm are communicated. This is a norm in the English language, where words commonly are given new definitions when the old definitions no longer are useful.</p>
